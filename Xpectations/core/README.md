# Xpectations by CodingCosmic

Xpectations is an advanced reverse engineering tool designed for x86 analysis, cybersecurity, and national security operations. It supports disassembly, shellcode detection, ROP chain identification, and more, while providing an easy-to-use interface for uploading and analyzing various file formats.

## Features

- **Disassembly and Analysis**: Efficiently disassemble and analyze x86 binaries.
- **Shellcode Detection**: Identify known and potential shellcode patterns.
- **ROP Chain Detection**: Detect Return-Oriented Programming chains and similar exploits.
- **Obfuscation Detection**: Detect and de-obfuscate code using advanced techniques.
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple binaries at once, generating comprehensive reports.
- **Live Memory Analysis**: Analyze live memory dumps to detect hidden processes and injected code.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Scan network traffic for embedded malicious code.
- **Interactive Mode**: Step through code manually and adjust analysis parameters on-the-fly.
- **File Upload**: Easily upload EXE, MacOS binaries, and more for automated analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook Integration**: Use the tool through interactive Jupyter Notebooks for ease of use and advanced data visualization.
- **Future Enhancements**: AI, machine learning, and quantum simulation capabilities will be added in future releases.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Jupyter Notebook** (if using notebooks)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   $git clone https://github.com/CodingCosmic/Xpectations.git
   cd Xpectations

Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip:


$pip install -r requirements.txt

Install the Xpectations Package

Run the setup script to install Xpectations as a Python package:

$python setup.py install

(Optional) Running Xpectations in Docker

If you prefer to use Docker for a more isolated environment:

$docker build -t xpectations .
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -it xpectations
Using GitHub Codespaces

Create a new Codespace for the Xpectations repository.
Install dependencies within the Codespace using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Launch Jupyter Notebooks within the Codespace for an interactive experience.

### Developer's Statement

I, Hernan H-N (CodingCosmic), developed Xpectations out of my love for Ghidra and Jupyter Notebooks. My passion for these tools inspired me to create a version that can eventually train AI models and machine learning algorithms for quantum simulation of quantum threats, exploits, and reverse engineering. This project aims to help protect systems against this new wave of threats, ensuring that cybersecurity evolves alongside quantum technologies.

This project is a product of Omnicorpdynamics™.
