### Developer's Statement

I, Hernan H-N (CodingCosmic), developed Xpectations out of my love for Ghidra and Jupyter Notebooks. My passion for these tools inspired me to create a version that can eventually train AI models and machine learning algorithms for quantum simulation of quantum threats, exploits, and reverse engineering. This project aims to help protect systems against this new wave of threats, ensuring that cybersecurity evolves alongside quantum technologies.

This project is a product of Omnicorpdynamics™.
